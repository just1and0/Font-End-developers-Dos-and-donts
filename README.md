## The Do's 👍
- 😎Make stuff! no matter how wacky the idea sounds, JUST BUILD !
- 😀Already good in a certain framework? that's fine, now learn a new javascript framework. 
- ✔️Connect with the community (github, twitter, e.t.c)
- 😍Contribute to the community. Build tools, share codes, get involved!
- 🕶️Have a mentor. Not necessarily a Senior Developer with 20+ years of experience. No. Anyone who knows more than you and understand things better is just fine.
- 🥰Learn and learn, something is always changing , stay current and never stop learning.
- 🔥 Help Others!  As soon as you start feeling quite confident about your skills and knowledge, start helping others.
- 🤩Create Portfolio Page
- 🤗Do use Git and Version Control Systems (e.g. Git, Subversion, Mercurial)
- 🤪Continue to learn what you’re interested in
- 🥂Hang out on CodePen. There’s so much inspiration over there.


## And here are the Don'ts👎
- 💩Don't learn the Javascript framework if you don't know the language!(Javascript).
- 📛Don't deceive yourself. you can't become a frontend developer without knowing javascript! forget the whole Dart or Coffeescript talk. First learn javascript. 
- 🤦Don't learn the Javascript framework if you have no solid foundation in CSS/HTML.
- 🚨Do not! i repeat, Don't start learning a a Javascript framework if you have no idea of css. DON'T!
- 😭 Don't start learning  a Javascript framework if you have no idea of CSS Preprocessors
- 😟Don't start learning a Javascript framework if you don't know how the browser works!
- 🙍Don't learn a Javascript framework if you have no idea of how to build APIs.
- 🙁Don’t be Ashamed of Not Knowing Something, do your best and learn!
- 🥺Just don't if you have no idea on Testing and Debugging
- 🚩Don't start this race is you have no clue of  **JSON**
- 🥴Don't learn it for money! 
- 😱Don’t worry about trying to learn everything. It's ok to try out a new framework to see what it's about but don't stress bout it.
